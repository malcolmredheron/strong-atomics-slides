# The case for fusion

Cheaper than renovating SF MOMA and the Bay Bridge
Why we need fusion and how we can have it for less less than you think

# We need lots of clean energy

- The physics of greenhouse gases is very simple: CO2 warms the planet
- Energy usage will probably [double by 2100](https://globalchange.mit.edu/publications/signature/2014-energy-and-climate-outlook)
- World market for energy is ~$1T

note:
- Energy is closely connected to prosperity. A world with more wealthy people
    will need more energy.
- Market size comes from global energy use of 1.5e17 Wh
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption) and a low estimate of
  $0.01 per kWh.

# Solutions

- Renewables
- Storage
- Efficiency
- Grid improvements

note:
Renewables and storage are getting cheaper, giving people hope.
And efficiency improvements often pay for themselves.
We should do all of these things, but they aren't enough.

# But it doesn't work

- [Bad assumptions](http://m.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722.full.pdf?with-ds=yes)
- [80% of a grid that's too small](http://denning.atmos.colostate.edu/ats543/Grid/MacDonald.supplementary.nclimate2921-s1.pdf)
- [Climate Change without the Hot Air](https://www.withouthotair.com/)

note:
Bad assumptions:
- how fast we can update every building in the world
- the cost of borrowing money (they use a figure that's about half of the real cost)

80% of a grid that's too small:
- optimistic paper that still relies on gas and nuclear for 20% of electricity
- doesn't figure in the grown in electricity demand from electrifying other
  energy usage

Climate Change without the Hot Air:
- Shows just how hard it is for the UK to run off renewables

note:

Fission:
- At the moment we are closing our nuclear reactors, not building new ones
- Carbon-free, but a host of problems
- Even the best new reactor designs typically only solve one or two of these
  problems.

Fusion:
- How it works, triple product
- MCF and ICF
- Abundant fuel - water and lithium
- So, what's not to like?

# Broken promises

- No net energy yet
- Expensive progress
- ITER: $20B, 2100

note:
- Before we talk about why this is exciting, let's recap why most people have
  dismissed it.
- More energy in than out
- Making this worse, people have been claiming that tokamaks were close to
  breakeven for decades. After each experiment failed to get to breakeven, the
  projected cost and time for the next one were larger.
- Tokamaks, generally considered the leading MCF approach, struggle with plasma
  instabilities, heat loss, size/cost, material challenges and a host of others.
- The flagship in this space is ITER, an international collaboration in France.
  It only gets a low density plasma so to make a useful amount of energy it
  needs to be large. And that makes it slow and expensive. It will cost tens of
  B$ and aims to put energy on the grid in 2100.

# What's changed?

- Exponential progress
- New tools/tech
- Alternative approaches
- Designed to be practical
- Private companies

note:
- tech: learned about plasma, faster computers, better simulations, better
  magnets, active control

---

# New approaches

- Magnetic: MIT ARC, CTFusion, Tokamak Energy
- Inertial: First Light Fusion
- Magneto inertial: Tri Alpha, Helion, General Fusion, Zap, MIFTI, HyperJet,
  CFS
- Electrostatics: EMC2, Fusion One
- Fission/fusion hybrid: Apollo Fusion

note:
MIF:
- confine and compress the fuel partly with magnetism and partly with inertia
- sounds crazy - you now have to do two hard things instead of one
- but by using both approaches you don't have to go to the extreme on either one
- and that lets you save a lot of money
- the magnetic field also helps to confine the plasma, and its heat, which makes
  it easier to reach breakeven
- 1% of the cost of magneto or inertial

# Results

note:
- graph shows what an MIF design might cost
- Zap's results support this

---

# What's wrong?

- Government money goes to ITER
- DOE: politics
- Google X: ROI timelines
- Breakthough Energy Ventures: still getting started
- Track record and disagreement scare investors

note:
- US and Russia in a race for fusion, doubled down on tokamaks

---

# Portfolio approach

- Start with 4-7 approaches
- Narrow the portfolio over time

note:
- This diversity of approaches is good, enables a portfolio
- A sensible investor would invest in a portfolio of these approaches
- NASA TRLs and a portfolio approach

# Portfolio approach

Milestone <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> | Cost/time <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->      | Comparison <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
----------|-----------|-----------
Breakeven <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> | 10 years, $500M <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->| Renovating SF MOMA, $600M <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Reactor <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->   | 10 years, $2B <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->  | Bay bridge retrofit, $6B <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

note:
- Costs and times are based on the time required for similar tasks based on
  research that ARPA-E did.

# Recap

- World market for energy is ~$1T, doubling by 2100
- We need clean, dispatchable energy
- Fusion is promising but underinvested
- $500M/10 years to get to breakeven
- IPO likely after that

Smart investment for the world and for profit

note:
- If we have fusion we can simplify our energy system, with less reliance on
  storage, demand management, etc.
